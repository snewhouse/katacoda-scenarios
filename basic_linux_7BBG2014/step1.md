This module is a brief overview of the most common commands to work with directories:
pwd, cd, ls, mkdir and rmdir. These commands are available on any Linux (or Unix)
system.

This module also discusses absolute and relative paths and path completion in the bash
shell.

##Â pwd

Where am I?...

The you are here sign can be displayed with the **pwd** command **(Print Working Directory)**.
Go ahead, try it: Open a command line interface (also called a terminal, console or xterm)
and type `pwd`. The tool displays your current directory.


`pwd`{{execute}}

```bash
pwd
```

## cd 

You can change your current directory with the cd command (Change Directory).

`cd`{{execute}}

## cd ~

The cd is also a shortcut to get back into your home directory. Just typing cd without a target
directory, will put you in your home directory. Typing cd ~ has the same effect.

`cd ~`{{execute}}
