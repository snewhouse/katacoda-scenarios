## 11: Man pages

If every Unix command has so many options, you might be wondering how you find out what they are and what they do. Well, thankfully every Unix command has an associated 'manual' that you can access by using the `man` command. E.g.

```bash
man ls
man cd
man man # yes even the man command has a manual page
```

When you are using the man command, press `space` to scroll down a page, `b` to go back a page, or `q` to quit. You can also use the up and down arrows to scroll a line at a time. The man command is actually using another Unix program, a text viewer called `less`, which we'll come to later on.
