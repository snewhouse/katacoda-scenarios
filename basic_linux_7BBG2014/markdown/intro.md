# Command-line Bootcamp
This is the command-line bootcamp, a tutorial that teaches you how to work at the command-line. You'll learn all the basic skills needed to start being productive in the UNIX terminal.

## Introduction

This 'bootcamp adventure' is intended to provide the reader with a basic overview of essential Unix/Linux commands that will allow them to navigate a file system and move, copy, edit files. It will also introduce a brief overview of some 'power' commands in Unix.

## Why Unix?

The [Unix operating system][Unix] has been around since 1969. Back then there was no such thing as a graphical user interface. You typed everything. It may seem archaic to use a keyboard to issue commands today, but it's much easier to automate keyboard tasks than mouse tasks. There are several variants of Unix (including [Linux][Linux]), though the differences do not matter much for most basic functions.

Unix is particularly suited to working with text files, even very large ones, and has several powerful (and flexible) commands that can process your data for you. The real strength of learning Unix is that most of these commands can be combined in an almost unlimited fashion. So if you can learn just five Unix commands, you will be able to do a lot more than just five things.
