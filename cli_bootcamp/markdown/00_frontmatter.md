Command-line examples that you are meant to type into a terminal window, and the results of those examples, will be shown in a grey code block, e.g.

```bash
ls -lrh
```

## Terminal Integration
You can also send code directly to the terminal. These code snippets or code blocks will be formatted as follow:

Allow a code block to be executed `some-command`{{execute}}

Allow a code block to be copied `some-command`{{copy}}

Sometimes the accompanying text will include a reference to a Unix command. Any such text will also be in a constant-width, boxed font. E.g.

>Type the `pwd` command.

From time to time this documentation will contain [web links][] to pages that will help you find out more about certain Unix commands. Usually, the _first_ mention of a command or function will be a hyperlink to Wikipedia. Important or critical points will be styled like so:

>***This is an important point!***

[web links]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink

****

>**IMPORTANT: Please run the following command before proceeding!!!!**

If you are not already set as USER `learner`, run the following commands:- 

`sudo -i -u learner && source .bashrc && clear`{{execute}}
