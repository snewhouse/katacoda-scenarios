You've seen how to remove a directory with the `rmdir` command, but `rmdir` won't remove directories if they contain any files. So how can we remove the files we have created (inside `learning_unix/temp`)? In order to do this, we will have to use the [rm][] (remove) command.

>***Please read the next section VERY carefully. Misuse of the `rm` command can lead to needless death & destruction. YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING***

Potentially, `rm` is a very dangerous command; if you delete something with `rm`, you will not get it back! It is possible to delete everything in your home directory (all directories and subdirectories) with `rm`, that is why it is such a dangerous command.

Let me repeat that last part again. **It is possible to delete EVERY file you have ever created with the `rm` command**.

Are you scared yet? You should be.

Luckily there is a way of making `rm` a little bit safer. We can use it with the `-i` command-line option which will ask for confirmation before deleting anything (remember to use tab-completion).

Run the following commands, and type "y" (for yes) to indicate you truly intend to delete the files.

```bash
learner@:learning_unix$ cd temp
learner@:temp$ ls
earth.txt  heaven.txt  rags  temp2
learner@:temp$ rm -i earth.txt heaven.txt rags
rm: remove regular empty file earth.txt? y
rm: remove regular empty file heaven.txt? y
rm: remove regular empty file rags? y
learner@:temp$ ls
temp2
```

`cd temp`{{execute}}

`ls`{{execute}}

`rm -i earth.txt heaven.txt rags`{{execute}}

`ls`{{execute}}


We could have simplified this step by using a wild-card (e.g. `rm -i *.txt`) or we could have made things more complex by removing each file with a separate `rm` command.

Let's finish cleaning up:

```bash
learner@:temp$ rmdir temp2
learner@:temp$ cd ..
learner@:learning_unix$ rmdir temp
learner@host01:~/learning_unix$ ls
learner@host01:~/learning_unix$
```


`rmdir temp2/`{{execute}}

`cd ..`{{execute}}

`rmdir temp`{{execute}}

`ls`{{execute}}
