**Do not try this! This linux terminal is buggy when using man pages in this tutorial. Just read this bit!**
**If you type `man [some command]` you will need to start again!**

If every Unix command has so many options, you might be wondering how you find out what they are and what they do. Well, thankfully every Unix command has an associated 'manual' that you can access by using the `man` command. E.g.

```bash
man ls
man cd
man man # yes even the man command has a manual page
```

When you are using the man command:

- press `space` to scroll down a page.
- `b` to go back a page.
- `q` to quit.

You can also use the up and down arrows to scroll a line at a time.

The man command is actually using another Unix program, a text viewer called `less`, which we'll come to later on.

## If in doubt: Google It!

These days, most of us just use Google. You will find all the answers there.

Try searching for `man ls linux` in Google - or even `ls linux command` or `cd linux command`...and see what you get.
