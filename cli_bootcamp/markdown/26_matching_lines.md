You will often want to search files to find lines that match a certain pattern. The Unix command [grep][] does this (and much more). The following examples show how you can use grep's command-line options to:

+ show lines that match a specified pattern
+ ignore case when matching (`-i`)
+ only match whole words (`-w`)
+ show lines that don't match a pattern (`-v`)
+ Use wildcard characters and other patterns to allow for alternatives (`*`, `.`, and `[]`)
